# **Oranges Grading Based on Fruit Diameter Using Digital Image Processing**
> According to data from the Central Statistics Agency (Badan Pusat Statistik or BPS) on Fruit Production in 2021, the total Siamese/tangerine oranges in Indonesia reached 2,401,064 tons. Balitjestro (Balai Penelitian Tanaman Jeruk dan Buah Subtropika) is one of the institutions dedicated to researching citrus fruits, especially Siamese oranges, tangerines, and lemons.

> Currently, the sorting process for oranges in Indonesia is mainly done manually, including at Balitjestro, which makes the post-harvest process less efficient and time-consuming. To address this issue, this project implements image processing to classify oranges based on the Indonesian National Standard (SNI 01-3165-1992) regarding fruit diameter. The method involves analyzing captured images of oranges, extracting features using contour detection, calculating the diameter, classifying the classes, and calculating the red-green ratio.
